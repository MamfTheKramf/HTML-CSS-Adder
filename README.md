# HTML-CSS-Adder
A binary adder that needs to be set up with JavaScript first but will then work with only HTML and CSS

Before you can start adding 2 binary numbers, you need to enter the bitlength of the larger number, so a small portion of JS can set up the adder. But be asured that after the generating is finished there will be no JS-Action happening. Everything else is done by CSS
